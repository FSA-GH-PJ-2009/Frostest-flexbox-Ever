## Getting Started

1.  Fork and clone this repo.
2.  `npm install`.
3.  Create `spicy-noodle-emporium` and `spicy-noodle-emporium-test` databases. See schema diagram at the bottom of this file.
4.  Start the build process and your application with: `npm run start-dev`. If you're using Windows, you may need to execute `npm run start-server` and `npm run build-watch` separately (in their own terminal tabs).
5.  Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see the site in the browser.
6.  Check out the mock-view in `wireframes` at the bottom of this file to see the basic layout of the site.
7.  Run the tests with: `npm test`.
8.  Check out the starting seed file in `seed.js` - you can run it by executing `npm run seed`. You will need to seed the database once you've set up the Sequelize models.
